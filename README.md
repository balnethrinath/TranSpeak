# TransSpeak 🌐🎙️

TransSpeak is a speech and text translation–based project designed to help users communicate across different languages more easily.  
It focuses on converting spoken or written input from one language to another in real time or near real time.

This project is built with an emphasis on **practical language translation workflows** and **hands-on learning in NLP and speech processing**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Language barriers often limit effective communication.  
TransSpeak aims to:
- Enable multilingual communication
- Translate spoken or textual input between languages
- Demonstrate real-world usage of translation technologies

The project serves as both a **functional prototype** and a **learning-oriented implementation**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎤 Speech-to-text processing
- 🌍 Language translation support
- 🗣 Text-to-speech output (where applicable)
- 🔄 End-to-end speech translation pipeline
- 🧠 Focus on clarity, accuracy, and usability

---

## 🧠 How It Works

TransSpeak follows a multi-step translation pipeline:

1. Speech input capture (or direct text input)
2. Speech-to-text conversion
3. Language translation processing
4. Text output or speech synthesis

The design prioritizes **modular processing**, allowing each stage to be improved independently.
